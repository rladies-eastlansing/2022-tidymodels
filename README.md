## About the meetup
Modeling and machine learning in R involve a bewildering array of heterogeneous packages, and establishing good statistical practice is challenging in any language. The tidymodels collection of packages offers a consistent, flexible framework for your modeling and machine learning work to address these problems. In this talk, speaker Julia Silge will focus on three specific reasons to consider using [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/). She will start with model characteristics themselves, move to the wise management of your data budget, and finish with feature engineering.
